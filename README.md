# A React-Node-MongoDb Blog Website Project

## Prerequisites

-Node.JS
-MongoDB

## About

- I've used Material UI components in this project.

- You can freely download, customize and use it in your own projects.

## Usage:

#Clone or download the project

#cd over apiserver and npm i packages

#Do this for the client and for the root folder of the project

#cd over apiserver and open package.json file

#find "dev": "start \"mongoServer\" \"c:Program Files/MongoDB/Server/4.4/bin/mongod.exe\" && nodemon index.js" line inside scripts section and change the MongoDb file path(it is the path where your MongoDB lives in)

#cd over the root and run the project with "npm run dev" for development

#It will start MongoServer, apiserver and client side respectively.

## Happy hacking:)
